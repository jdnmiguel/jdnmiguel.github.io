abstract: >
 Rapidly increasing mobile phone ownership and generative AI are rewriting the farm advisory playbook. We will demonstrate and assess effects of the agriculture domain-specific AI assistant, Farmer.Chat, developed by [Digital Green](https://digitalgreen.org/), which cost-effectively enables small-scale farmers to access contextualized farm advisory and triage questions.
