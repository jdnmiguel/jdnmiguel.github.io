  This article examines the differential price effects of cash versus in-kind transfers through Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), Africa's largest public works initiative. Exploiting the program's staggered implementation, I analyze monthly market price data from 2001–2015, integrating information on local prices, agricultural production, and program delivery to identify causal relationships.  
  Results show that cash transfers increase local prices by approximately 5%, while food transfers generate negative, albeit imprecisely estimated, price responses. This aggregate finding masks substantial heterogeneity: the distributed food items experience significant price reductions in localities receiving in-kind transfers. These effects are most pronounced in districts with higher treatment intensity, geographic isolation, and lower agricultural productivity. Using transfer share in district expenditures as a measure of treatment intensity, I estimate that a one percentage point increase in transfer share drives a 1.02% price increase in cash-dominant districts versus a 0.82% price decrease in food-dominant districts. Further investigation of mechanisms reveals that cash transfers facilitate supply-side responses through enhanced agricultural production, partially mitigating price inflation. However, these productive gains come with welfare trade-offs—children under five years exhibit higher rates of underweight and stunting in cash-dominant districts, suggesting that localized price increases may compromise nutritional outcomes despite productivity improvements.
