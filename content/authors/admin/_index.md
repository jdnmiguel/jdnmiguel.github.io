## Welcome to my academic website
 
I am a Post-doctoral researcher in Economics at the Bordeaux School of Economics and SPIA Country Affiliate for Ethiopia. I am currently visiting NOVAfrica. I defended in October 2024, see my [dissertation](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04807008). My research focuses on agricultural transformation, local value-chain, and rural markets in Sub-Saharan Africa. I was a Fulbright visiting scholar at UC - Berkeley in 2022-2023.
